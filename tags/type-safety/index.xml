      <description>I have on and off again tried to use mypy to type check my python code, but some shortcomings of Python&#39;s type annotation system really get in the way. This came now because I needed to write code involving trees that had to change the types of values stored on the nodes. This highlighted a few serious shortcomings for anyone that is accostumed to use stronger type systems.
The ugly syntax for function types is annoying but there are worse problems Yes, writing Callable[[Callable[[A], B], F[A]], F[B]] instead of (a -&amp;gt; b) -&amp;gt; f a -&amp;gt; f b as in Haskell or (A =&amp;gt; B, F[A]) =&amp;gt; F[B] (or maybe the uncurried (A =&amp;gt; B) =&amp;gt; (F[A] =&amp;gt; F[B]) version) as in Scala is really annoying.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been recently trying to learn more advanced type-level constructs in Haskell and was very happy to find this amazing talk by Prof. Stephanie Weirich about Dependent Types in haskell. This talk helped me to understand deeper a few more recent concepts introduced by some of GHC&#39;s extensions and how to use them. In this post I want to focus a little bit in a simplified version of one of the data structures Prof.</description>
