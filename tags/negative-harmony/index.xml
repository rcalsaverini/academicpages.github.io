      <description>Intro Recently I&#39;ve been listening to a 12tone video on YouTube about negative harmony, a concept recently popularized by musician Jacob Collier. On the related links I found a bunch of videos from this channel with &amp;ldquo;negative harmony&amp;rdquo; versions of many popular songs.
The change in sonority of those songs clearly indicated for me a change in the mode of the song, which kind of go against the grain of what I&#39;ve been told about the action of those transformations.</description>
