      <description>The recent disgusting display in Charlottesville, where thousands of fascists and nazis1 where demonstrating their hatred and bigotry, triggered a lot of bashing against centrists, libertarians and people from the liberal camp2. At first that made me a little puzzled. I frequently identify myself as a centrist liberal and I was trying to understand why people were blaming people like me for what happened. Than I understood what happened: there were actually a lot of self styled centrists and libertarians defending the Nazis from Charlottesville!</description>
